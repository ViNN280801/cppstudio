You need to create a structure that contains an int type element and a string. Declare a pointer to a structure type (a structure object) and allocate memory to store data of a single structure. Invite the user to enter data and write it to the elements of the structure object. Next, the user needs to make a choice: add more data (create another structure object) or exit the program. If the user continues to enter, it is necessary to allocate new memory for the pointer to the structure object and add new data entered by the user to it. The cycle of allocating new memory continues until the user chooses to exit the program.
