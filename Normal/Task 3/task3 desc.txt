It is necessary to calculate the product of the matrix by the vector. In the resulting vector, find the maximum element. it is necessary to solve this problem in three ways:

    using static arrays
    use only dynamic arrays with explicit pointer dereference
    use only dynamic arrays, address array elements using indexes.

That is, you should have three separate sources â€” three programs.
