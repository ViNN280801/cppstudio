The task of dynamic memory allocation. Initially, there is a pointer to an array with one element. The user enters a number. If it is greater than 0, we write it to the array. Next, the user enters the second number, then, if it is greater than 0, it is necessary to reallocate the memory for 2 elements of the array and write the second number to the array. And so on... for 3 elements, for 4... until the user enters a negative number.
