Develop a program for plotting the function y = 2sin xe^4/5. Read x functions from the file. 
Plot the function in the range from -50 to 50. The result of the program will be 
considered two arrays that contain intermediate values of x and y for the 
interval [-50; 50]. Plot a graph based on these values.
